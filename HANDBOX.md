## Preface: The Origin of Stimulus

We write a lot of Javascript at [37signals](https://37signals.com/), but we don't use it to create "Javascript applications" in the contemporary sense. All our applications have server-side rendered HTML at their core, then add sprinkles of Javascript to make them sparkle.

This is the way of the [majestic monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/). 37signals runs across half a dozen platforms, including native mobile apps, with a single set of controllers, views, and models created using Ruby on Rails. having a single, shared interface that can be updated in a single place key to being able to perform with a small team, despite the many platforms.

It allows us to party with productivity like days of yore. A throwback to when a single programmer could make rapacious progress without getting stuck in layers of indirection or distributed system. A time before everyone thought the holy grail was to confine their server-side application to producing JSON for a JavaScript-based client application.

And it's also not to say that the proliferation of single-page Javascript applications hasn't brought real benefit. Chief amongst which has been faster, more fluid interfaces set free from the full-page refresh.

We wanted Basecamp to feel like that too. As though we had followed the herd and rewritten everythong with client-side rendering or gone full-native on mobile.

This desire led us to a two-punch solution: Turbo and Stimulus.
